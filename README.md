As a highly motivated and coachable full stack developer, I am looking forward to continuing to develop my overall abilities wherever my career takes me.

# Projects

## <a href='https://github.com/robertoooc/TypingTestApp-client' target="_blank">Typing Test Frontend</a>

### Mongoose/Express/React/Node/Typescript/Tailwind/Victory

I developed a Typing Test App that allows you to take random typing tests which will in return tells you which characters you had the most mistakes on. From here you are given the chance to further take more tests focusing on the area that needs most improvement. You also have the chance to view results of previous tests and compare progress.

### Postgres/Express/React/EJS/Musixmatch API/Last.fm API

A music app using a simple user authentication through storing user information in cookies. Incorporated two unrelated third party api's and enabled them to work together to gather song information and album images, works proficiently over 90% of time. Apart from letting users search songs and artists, this app allows a user to create playlists with the options of public or private playlists. Allows users to also view other's public playlists and perform actions such as liking and commenting on them.
